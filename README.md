# README -- Code The Dream Backend 2 Week 1 class

This repository contains the framework for the blog application you will develop as you go through the Treehouse videos on Rails development.
You should create a git branch called backend2-lesson-1 and make your changes to that branch. You should add and commit your changes periodically,
and you should push them to github periodically as well.  Then, on completion of the Treehouse Rails videos, once you have made all the changes
to your version of the blog application that the instructor in the videos has made, you can submit a pull request for review.

After you clone your assignment repository, be sure to run bundle install before you try to bring up the code.  That will be necessary for
subsequent backend2 assignments as well, especially for week 4.

As you watch the videos, be sure you make all the changes that the instructor is making to his version of the application.  Otherwise you won't
remember the video content.  At several times during the videos, the instructor shows alternate ways of doing things.  You should comment out what
you have instead of erasing it, so that you have a record of each way to implement a particular function.

The blog application is modified in the Treehouse videos for Ruby on Rails 5 Basics, Rails Routes and Resources, and Active Record Associations
in Rails. You are done with it when you have completed that last video.  The Active Record Associations in Rails video also involves several
other Rails applications, and there are separate assignments and workspaces for those.
